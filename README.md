# Exquisite Corpse

finally! a project!

anna remind me to give you to env file so its not public on github

todo:

things to consider
race conditions with people joining -- how to update what is next if someone is currently drawing but didnt save yet
on second thought, we should disallow this, bc there would be no leaving off point for them to draw...
max one person per game


what if someone quits without saving
